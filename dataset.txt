(Just Like) Starting Over	Lennon	Our life together is so precious together,\We have grown - we have grown,\Although our love is still special,\Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone,\It's been so long since we took the time,\No-one's to blame,\I know time flies so quikly,\But when I see you darling,\It's like we both are falling in love again,\It'll be just like starting over - starting over,\Everyday we used to make it love,\Why can't we be making love nice and easy,\It's time to spread our wing's and fly,\Don't let another day go by my love,\It'll be just like starting over - starting over,\Why don't we take off alone,\Take a trip far, far away,\We'll be together on our own again,\Like we used to in the early days,\Well, well, well darling,\It's been so long since we took the time,\No-one's to blame,\I know time flies so quikly,\But when I see you darling,\It's like we both are falling in love again,\It'll be just like starting over - starting over,\Everyday we used to make it love,\Why can't we be making love nice and easy,\It's time to spread our wing's and fly,\Don't let another day go by my love,\It'll be just like starting over - starting over,\Our life together is so precious together,\We have grown - we have grown,\Although our love is still special,\Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone.
A Day In The Life	N/A	I read the news today oh boy\About a lucky man who made the grade\And though the news was rather sad\Well I just had to laugh\I saw the photograph.\He blew his mind out in a car\He didn't notice that the lights have changed\A crowd of people stood and stared\They'd seen his face before\Nobody was really sure\If he was from the House of Lords.\I saw a film today oh boy\The English Army had just won the war\A crowd of people turned away\But I just had to look\Having read the book\I'd love to turn you on.\Woke up, fell out of bed,\Dragged my comb across my head\Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,\And looking up I noticed I was late.\Found my way coat and grabbed my hat\Made the bus in seconds flat\Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,\Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.\I read the news today oh boy\Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire\And though the holes were rather small\They had to count them all\Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.\I'd love to turn you on.

Within You Without You	Harrison	We were talking - about the space between us all\And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion\Never glimpse of truth - then it's far too late - when they pass away\We were talking - about the love we could all share - when we find it\To try our best to hold it there - with our love\With our love - We could save the world - if they only knew\Try to realise it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change\And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on\wit-hin and wit-hout you\We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people,\Who gain the world and lose their soul - then you may find,\pea-ce of mind, is waiting there\And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within and without you
