 Pam, sing. It doesn't matter what you say. You'll make it and I will.
Lennon & McCartney
So now I'm your only blue-collar man
Got the blue collar, you got the black, you got the blue,
Yeah. It's true, I'm your only blue collar,
Yeah. You've all lived your life
The blue has faded, the tan has faded.
Hear me now - you've all gone - they are gone.
But I guess if you'd show me you were happy
I could see the day - I could see...
So I got that blue suit and tie
Yeah yeah, you got all the gear
All the stuff you could've bought
All the games you could be at
All the tricks from the game,
And the only thing you've ever done
You've all been through the queue
All the time you could have spent
You've all been through the queue
All the time you could have seen,
All I can remember is how fast you've been moving
All I can remember is how you pulled the trigger
And you never had to explain
You know you'll be a rocker and a rollin' song
By the time you roll over
You know the thrill of it all
But the thrill is over when you win,
You know the thrill is over when you lose.
You knew you'd lose,
But now you've got time to save
You know that you're losing,
And now it's you again
Time to run, you know that you've lost
But you've never lost
You don't know you'll be back
But all you have to do is hold your head
And shake it all the time
So take it easy
Don't be late
Just don't be late
Just make it count
Don't be late
You know you're gonna play
And it's gonna be alright
You know you're gonna win
And now you've got time to save
You know that you're losing,
But you've never lost
You don't know you'll be back
But all you have to do is hold your head
And shake it all the time
So take it easy
Don't be late
Just don't be late
Just make it count
Don't be late
Just make it count


Take It easy
Lennon & McCartney
Oh how I feel.
All the world's a dream.
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy You're taking it easy
Oh how I feel.
All the world's a dream.
Take it easy take it easy


Take It easy
Harrison
Well you know that a little bit of a feat can go a long way.
So take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy


I know you won't deny me that you love me
I know you won't challenge me that you love me
But now you've got to understand
Your heart's on me
You know that in times of adversity
you must be patient
And when you come home safely to me
I knew you would love me too.


You'll love me forever
Lennon & McCartney
Oh you've got to feel my love.
You've got to feel my love,
You've got to feel my love,
You've got to feel my love,
You have got to feel my love you've got to feel my love
And so you go and know that I'll make your day.

on's friend, to see her again when his long-lost son is away.
As the sun has gone down, she's still there.
As the sun has gone down, she's still there.
As the sun has gone down, she's still there.


The Ballad Of John And Mary
AUGUST 9:
Auld and Noble George
Auld and Noble George, I've come to the end of my life,
I'll never live without you, oh oh oh oh
When my soul has gone, I'll never be afraid to go again
And now I've found a friend that will love me back again, oh oh oh oh
I'd rather be here.
Auld and Noble George, I've made a wish for you, my little girl,
And I've made a wish for you, dear girl, oh oh oh oh oh
Auld and Noble George, I've been a fool over making a wish.
I never knew such a thing.
Auld and Noble George, I've pulled apart your heart,
With your tears welling up in your eyes.
And now my wish is here to you, my little girl,
Oh my oh oh oh


The Last Temptation Song
Lennon
The way you go has a meaning that no-one knows
You think it means things to you
You go from being another person to an institution
And then when you're gone, they go again
You know they will always be there
You wonder why nobody has ever told you
The last time they saw you, they went away again
You know they are always there, you know they never leave you
It's a feeling that keeps you from feeling it, oh oh oh oh


The Love Song
Lennon & McCartney
A loving letter to a lonely girl
When my love is found the tears start to flow
Oh the tears run in your eyes
When my love is found the tears start to flow
Oh I hope it's you
A love that's lasted so many years
There will always be an apple to eat on the table
Oh I hope it's you
The love that's lasted so many lives too
There is no longer anything left to eat on the table
Oh I hope it's you
It's just the love that's lasted so many years
There is no longer anything left to eat on the table
Oh I hope it's you
There is no longer anything left to eat on the table


The Woman Who Loved Me So
Harrison
(as recorded by oo)
Won't you tell me,
how do you feel,
when you think of love
Love is gone
and you wonder why
Don't you tell me,
how do you feel,
when you think of love
When you're young and lonely and don't have the time for romance
It's like a hole is filling you
And you know that it's filling me


There Should Be A Police
Curtis
If you have to be at all
In your head and your soul is in your hands


There's Only One Queen
Bjorn
There's onlyone queen, queen, queen
We all know the story of the princess.
Her name is Joko.
The tree that pruned the leaves was a tree that gave birth to our two children.
And when the tree was red and leaves were black,
What a scene!
It was so thrilling for me and so many,
I knew
it was going to happen.
She was there before us,
Before, when her sister died,
She was there all alone.
She was there alone, never to be seen.
Before her death, when the world was passing away,
She gave our two little girls hope to know,
When she died,
She gave us all hope to know.
There's onlyone queen, queen, queen


P.S. I have more love than your heart can carry
I've got more love than your mind can carry
Oh yeah.
Thank you to my long time girlfriend, mabel,
for loving me like I was loved for
six weeks
It's funny that the love that you live for is going to vanish,
and the love that I love for still stands.
I love you, dear and good,
it's all you and me.
I love you, dear and good,


Penelope Island
Harrison
Little girl, little girl,
Sit down babe, sit down babe
Penelope Island, penelope island
Well, little girl, little girl
Penelope Island, penelope island


Penelope Queen
Lennon & McCartney
Penelope queen... girl, little girl,
Can I have a little bottle of wine,
Take a ride on the boat, oh baby

 baby if you want me
My sweet little darling can't you see
how wonderful it is when you're mine
If only I could be your lover forever.
I can never get my heart, I can't get my mind,
I can't get my lips, I can't get my feet.
I can't get my hands, I can't get my feet.


Take a Walk
Harrison
You know what to do
Well I know what to do
I can't walk my dog's feet
I can't walk my dog's heels
I can't walk my dog's feet
I can't walk my dog's feet
If I could I'd take a walk
Would you be the man and I would be together
I can't wait
If you could give me a wish
I can't wait
You could give it all but your heart
Would you be the man and I would be together
I can't wait
Well I know what to do
Well I know what to do
I can't walk my dog's feet
I can't walk my dog's heels
I can't walk my dog's feet

The Ballad Of John And Yoko
Lennon & McCartney
I'm a long way from home
from the land
I've got a lot on my mind
to see if I can feel
my feet again
As I wander down the street
Tall I can hear the music
Of John And Yoko
On the way home
from the land
I've got a lot on my mind
to see if I can feel
my feet again
As I wander down the street
Tall I can, I'm a long way, away
from the land
The ballad of John And Yoko
The ballad of Yoko - John And Yoko!
And Yoko's Theme
By the Ballad Of John And Yoko
Where The Ballad Of John And Yoko
Watches The World
(Watches The World)
As I wander through the street
The music is shining through the light
From the ballad of John And Yoko
Where the ballad of Yoko - John And Yoko!


The Team
Lennon & McCartney
You said it best.
I said it best.
I'm a long way from home

Treasure these things you've done
With the boys who work for us - The boy - The boy!
You said it best.

You've got a lot on your mind
to see if you can dance.
That's the way
To celebrate your birthday

If you ever want
to hurt us,
just give us a ride - The boys - The boys!

The only man I've ever known was so smart and he never told you he was mine.
Well, I know what I want, how I can get.
You can have a heart attack and you can live.
I said goodbye, I'm sure they would know you better.
I'm a fool for saying goodbye, I'm guaranteed a heart attack and a heart attack.


Woman
Lennon & McCartney
Woman, this is a woman
And I don't like and I don't love you,
I really don't like you now,
And here I stand with my heart shattered,
And woman I trust.
Woman, I love you now, this is a woman
And I don't even like you,
I really don't like you,
And here I stand holding my woman high.
Woman, look at me
I love you, believe me when I tell you,
You don't love me anymore than this is a woman.
Woman, look at me, I'll never change.
Man, this is a woman
And I don't like and I don't love you,

Woman in Black
Lennon & McCartney
I’d make a scene
If you don't want me to appear
You might as well leave me alone.
I’m near death and I’m in love
So it's not funny doing what you do,
But as in life, you gotta give me back my life.
Oh won't you let me know,
I’m near death and I’m in love?
Should I take a chance with these two
People for yourself.
I’m near death and I’m in love.
Is there anything I can do?
And I’m making plans for the future.
We wouldn't be here today,
We were in such a state of mind.
I’m near death and I’m in love? oh
But as in life, you gotta give me back my life.
I’m near death and I’m in love? oh

Woman (Pervert)
Lennon & McCartney
She's a perverted dweeb, who loves to party,
Doesn't mind taking a lover if the man is sweet,
She's an easy girl to be prisioned.
And I should remember that I gave her one last chance,
For if she's no longer my girl,
Why should I let her in again?
I’m sending her flowers, wishing her success,
But I’m telling her she was destined to be a man,
She's an easy girl to be prisioned,
And I should remember that I gave her one last chance,
For if she's no longer my girl,
Why should I let her in again?
I’m sending her flowers, wishing her success,
But I’m telling her she was destined to be a man,
She's an easy girl to be prisioned.

And I will if I live to marry you.

But the one she really loves is mine 
For though she may seem small, she's a man
When she looks over her shoulder she sees the vastness of the world
And the beautiful things in our world she can do
For she is a man, and I will believe her and love her

Last Days
Lennon & McCartney
(as recorded by travail)
We spent the night with the dakotas
And we talked in the evening, the dakotas spent the night
Last days have passed
No more nights without sun
Resting my head in the sun
Last days have gone
Resting my head in the sun
Last days have gone
Last days have gone
My lonely and lonely
Last years dark sorrow and life long sorrow
My lonely and lonely
Last years dark sorrow and life long sorrow
There are no more cats


Love You Like No Other
Lennon & McCartney
Love You Like No Other
Just love you like no other
Like no other, just love you like no other
Like no other, just love you like no other

Look At Me
Lennon
Look at me, I see that you are lonely
Look at you, I see that you are mad
Look at me, I'm frightened
I know that you are waiting for me
Please don't ever touch me
Look at me, I see that you are funny
Look at me, I see that you are soft
Look at me, I see that you are strong
We know that you are unhappy
We know that you are smiling
We know that you are happy
'Tis what you do that make me happy
Look at me, I see that you are sad
Look at me, I see that you are small
We know that you are happy
We know that you are sad
Look at me, I see that you are strong
We know that you are strong
We know that you are.

The weather's not very good
You're driving me crazy
A little rain fell tonight
Rain won't do
Rain time
Don't take rain when you're sweaty
You can get wet in the middle of nowhere
Don't take chances by leaving me dirty
Don't take chances by leaving me a rat
Ah
The birds in the sky
Have spotted a golden egg
A man and his pegasus army
Made a fool of
The woman with the dumbbell.


Things We Said Today
Lennon & McCartney
Ah  ah  ah  ah ah  ah  ah
(Come on, Come on baby)
We said you've got everything you want
But you go looking for something
You know you've found nothing
Nothing but hate  Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah (come on, come on baby)
You don't get what you want
From what you googling you get
Not enough money to pay for you house
And a suitcase full o' soup (come on, come on baby)
Aah  ah  ah  ah  ah (come on, come on baby)
Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah
(Come on, come on baby)
Woke up this morning to a knock knock bang
Went out trying to pick myself up from the ground
Did I look difftreeth yer unloving my shoe
On my way home from work
I'm not sure what I was supposed to do
But I do know what I saw
And I will laugh it off as a joke
Yeh that's all I want you to do
Ah - Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah (come on, come on baby)


Young Blood
Lennon
Young Blood's warm and inviting heartbeats will make you cry
Cold blue skies and waves of sea
Understand it's such a sight to see
Young Blood sing a dirge o' that of ev'rybody
In the world it's easy to be forgotten
Young Blood's sound can be heard as it reaches across the room
Crys of warbling laughter, tears streaming from eyes
Yeh your eyes have seen the game before it's too late
Ain't nothing against magic, yeh the rule
Tuned to a natural E happy to be that way
Young Blood's other mains come equipped with sound mikes
Cooling their wheels with sound, tune in to the sound of the track
Runs like a spinnin' top, giving it a go
Young Blood sing a dirge o' that of ev'rybody
In the world it's easy to be forgotten
Young Blood's warm and inviting heartbeats will make you cry
Cold blue skies and waves of sea
Understand it's such a sight to see
Young Blood's sing a dirge o' that of ev'rybody
Oh yeh the sound of a car will make you shout aloud
Crying you son to the heavens, O yeh your word will bring ev'ryone into the fold
Yeh your voice will make all the world a-clappin'


Only Heaven
Lennon & McCartney
Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah
Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  ah  ah (oh my gosh)
Only heaven is above
And you are looking in vain
Oh come on now  If you don't treat me right now

And so she's dead.
I saw her six years old, man.
She shot dead twelve people, baby.
She insulted a policeman, yeah.
She shot dead twelve people, baby.
I held her down, pulled out a bean bag.
And then she began to cry.

She never cried, just me and yoko.
I held her tight, pulled her down, yeah.

Well she's got nothing on you
(But the jive)
But you know she's getting sweeter each day
I've got no time for you right now
For now.....well now.....well now.....well
She's got to 18 years old
Have you seen the tear as it's forming
Wipe it away with a tissue
She's got to be able to walk
(Up to her local Walgreens)
To be a hero of the poor guy
She's got to be able to talk
(To a man)
To a joker with a million other people
She's got to be able to run
(To himself)
Up and down the street
Sitting in his Staten Island-style
Creating multiple plays
The kind that he loved
From kissing to fist-pumping
The kind that he shot dead
Now he's moving west, west in his car
Wipe that tear away with a tissue
She's got to be able to run
A little boy playing with his turtle
Is frightened of you because of you
Now his sister is telling him
Things you would do
Would you rather see me dead, say I'm a killer
Sitting on a log in a field of grass
Wipe that tear away with a tissue
She's got to be able to run
A-la, A-la, A-la,
Please, please, please keep your hands to me, baby
Please, please, please, please.
The only thing that you're holding on to is my love.
You're holding it on tight, baby, please keep your hands to me,
Baby, keep your hands to me.
I'll never go away, I know I'm the one that you want to be with.
But you know I'll always be there with you, baby, I'll make you wish I was here.
You know I'll always be there with you, baby, I'll make you

What Goes On
Lennon & McCartney
When I find she seems to be gone
I look for her I catch her walking beside me
Why she must appear so unappealing
I catch her standing before me
Why she can dance
With all her charms
Could it be argued
That she is Ira I mean no use
It's understood
That she is gone
But what goes on
Is wasting my time
It's up to the dancer
So well known across the dancefloours
It's understood
That she is gone


What's the New Mary Jane
Lennon & McCartney
Nothing can compare to the many wonderful things that this world can hold
What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane

What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane
What's the new Mary Jane
Oh what a joy for ev'ry girl and boy
I meet the new Mary Jane in the street corner
Looking to get her into our lives
We make her dance and sing our song
And then she goes home
We made her a drink of wine
And after dancing for ten years we fell in love
Things went well until we found that she was real
And we found out she was us
Things went well until we found that she was us
Things went well until we found that she was us


What's the New Lizzie
Lennon & McCartney
What's the New Lizzie
What's the New Lizzie
When I find she isn't smiling or waving her wand
My heart's in the right mood
She'll be so kind as to let me know
That she's not a tomboy
She won't be so kind as to break my heart
When I catch her smiling before me
What's the New Lizzie
What's the New Lizzie
What's the New Lizzie
What's the new Lizzie
What's the new Lizzie
What's the new Lizzie

All the world is birthday cake so take a piece
but what's the new Lizzie

What's on the Water
Lennon & McCartney
What's on the water? What's on the water?
What's on the water?
What's on the water?
Yes I'm asking you, dear one,
What's on the water?
What's on the water?

Nothing to be afraid of.
I'd give my head to see
Any sign of movement
On the road.
I'd give my eyes to see
The window's up.
I'd give my ears to hear
The music playing.
It's getting louder and louder
By the hour.
I'd give my head to hear
The wind is blowing,
Towering.
I'd give my eyes to see
Nothing to be afraid of.
We'd all love to see you
Now, Here Comes The Sun.
There comes this devil, Sun,
He's gone, He's gone now,
We'll all be glad, if you and I live.

You Really Got a Hold on Me
Lennon & McCartney
We first met back when she was just six years old
She was so shy around boys,
And I never really had a hold on me
I'm a shy girl
So won't you please let me love you
I've been shy around boys
I take my loved one back
And away I go
Oh oh  Oh oh Oh... oh  Oh
Girl, do you really want me
Any time, any place
I want it, I can't hide
My love for you baby
Is miles above compare
I will always be a lover
By love alone
You really got a hold on me
I've been shy around boys
And I never really had a hold on me

So won't you please let me love you

You Won't See Me
Lennon & McCartney
When I call you up your line's engaged,
I have had enough so act you age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If You won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
I don't know why you should feel so mad
But I know it's wrong, wrong, wrong
I don't know why you should feel so mad
But I know that You won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
Yeh, You don't know, You don't know

And I know that with You you will go
I will believe in you and love you
And You won't see me (You won't see me)


You'd Better Hide Your Dolls
Lennon & McCartney
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
If you ever leave me and I go I'll go,
As they say in heaven
In the dark I'll go
I'll go, hide my dolls,
I beg you, you bffs,
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
If you ever leave me and I go
And I tell you that with love all things good
They say in the dark,
In the dark hide your dolls,
Oh, they say in the dark hide your dolls
Oo - oo - oo
Ev'rywhere you are
The birds in the sky,
The bees on the tree,
The land is land.
You'd better hide your dolls,
If you ever leave me.
You'd better hide your dolls,
Oh, and hide your dolls,
Oh, and ev'rything that you do
Will be glad when you give me back my doll,
When ev'rything I do
The birds in the sky,
The bees on the tree,
The land is land.
You'd better hide your dolls,
If you ever leave me.
A bird won't fly if I'm true
To the bird,
When ev'rything I do
The birds in the sky,
The bees on the tree,
The land is land.
You'd better hide your dolls,
If you ever leave me.
A bird won't fly if I'm true
To the bird,
To the bird.
A bird won't fly if I'm true
To the bird,
To the bird.

 worry to see
That our love was good
And the world didn't round and then they did
Something nice for her to do
Then she wouldn't leave me no more
Nothing could be further from the truth
Just the way she treats us all
Like I love her
Please remember our love is all right
And if she sees us coming
She will see good in her love for me
She won't leave me no more
Nothing could be further from the truth
Just the way she treats us all
Like I love her
Please remember our love is all right
And if she sees us coming
She will see good in her love for me
She won't leave me no more
Nothing could be further from the truth
Just the way she treats us all

New York City
Lennon & McCartney
As I write this letter
Send to my friends
I don't want to stay in a city
Where people hide themselves
And nowhere is the place to be
For there is nothing to be afraid of
Nothing to lose if I go
Looking for someone to hate
Nothing to lose if I run out of things to do
Nothing to lose if I'm imprisoned by my pride
Nothing to lose if I'm tried and broken
And the farther away you are the more you are worth knowing
Nothing to lose if you go to town
Nothing to lose if you go to church
Nothing to lose if you go to school
Nothing to lose if you go to me
Nothing to lose if you go to me - Stuff like that you know
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose if you go to me
Nothing to lose if you go to me


No Reply
Lennon & McCartney
This happened once before when I was in love with a man
And the man said to me:
You know darling, it's no joke
You know it's what you do
that makes me happy
I know that it's true
And he said: No Reply
Promise you will never do me harm
I know that it's true
And he said: No Reply
Don't stick your fingers in my pie
I know that it's true
And he said: No Reply


Norwegian Wood (This bird has flown)
Lennon & McCartney
This bird has flown
And me and O.K.
It doesn't matter what we say
If she's Norwegian Wood, this bird has flown
I'd ask her to come and see
We have lost the only girl
With an eye for an answer
Norwegian wood.
We give her no answer and she wilt just like a log
Norwegian wood
This bird has flown
And me and O.K.
It doesn't matter what we say
If she's Norwegian Wood, this bird has flown
I'd ask her to come and see
We have lost the only girl
With an eye for an answer
Norwegian wood.


P.S. I Love You
Lennon & McCartney
As I write this letter
Send to my friends
I don't want to stay in a city
Where people hide themselves
And nowhere is the place to be
For there is nothing to be afraid of
Nothing to lose if I go
Looking for someone to hate
Nothing to lose if I play the game "Out of the Rain"
Nothing to lose if I die
Nothing to lose - Endorsement
So Come on, Come on, Come on....

Nobody's Fool
Lennon & McCartney
I don't care if I spent my golden ticket
It won't do you no good
I don't care if I lost my baby
It won't do you no good
I don't care if I lost my baby
I can't stand
I can't wait
For the day you will be mine
Where you can see me and all the world
I can't even begin to tell you
When I found out
I I stared
I could see my future
Somewhere in between
I'd hoped you would be
The one and only Elvis
I'd hoped you would be
The one and only Elvis
I couldn't walk on
I nearly fell off your legs
I was so shy
I couldn't tell you
When I held you near you held me near
You were such a sweet puppy
But as soon as you saw me
I held you near you I saw
You're not the sweetest puppy
I've ever met
You're the one and only Elvis
I couldn't walk on
I was so shy
I couldn't tell you
When I held you near you held me near
You were such a sweet puppy
But as soon as you saw me
I held you near you I saw
You're not the sweetest puppy
I've ever met
You're the one and only Elvis
I couldn't walk on
I was so shy
I couldn't tell you
When I held you near you held me near
You were such a sweet puppy
But as soon as you saw me

 tongue of wisdom
as ye
I think of all the world as mine
I lay my hands on wisdom
and love,
And before the world could laugh
She said the world is round it is
And I can see it's full of lies
She said there's no heaven
Nor can there be no hell
Nor can there be no oblivion
So she turned to the sun and said
This is the part of being
that can blind ignorance
I think of all the world as my field
She said the sun is round it is
And I can see it's full of lies
She said the sun is round it is
And I can see it's full of lies
She said the sun is round it is
And I can see it's full of lies

I fell in love with you when she was just six years old.
She tantalized me at first sight,
But as I got her older she got
much younger.
I fell in love with her
And though we're still far apart
We're still far apart
I fell in love with her once before,
And though we've both changed
She's still the same age

She's the same name
I'm oh icked,
I'm icky,
I'm icky and happy

Close your eyes,
Have no fear,
The monsters gone,
They have taken him away,
But there's so much to do,
Beautiful,
Beautiful, beautiful,
Beautiful Boy,
Before you go to sleep,
Say a little prayer,
Everyday in and of itself,
Give us all a chance,
To be near you,
Make a point of seeing you,
Make a wish,
Take the time,
To be near you,
Make a wish,
Give us all a chance,
Nothing could be further from you,
Let's be true

We live in a free republic,
We can dance and sing and beg while we like
We all live in a free republic,
Dance with us
Spoke in our best English,
So come on, English belted,
And take someone who understands
To heart you wimpy ta mean something.
Oh, komm doch,

The sun will be up,
the moon will be down.
Bye, yes you'll be
way out.
The birds will sing,
the tree will grow
and the horse will disappear.
Eleanor Rigby will sing
Happy birthday, my love,
I'll be on my way.
There will be no crushers
but the wind will blow,
martha lance she was forged
Will you still need me
than to go.
So go, go, go.
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
I'll be on my way.
Away from home,
sweet little my boy,
Where I'll always be,
The wiggles and wiggles of the wheel.
Will you still need me,
will you still need me,
Will I still need to go.
So go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
We're gonna walk,
talk, talk, talk
We're gonna hit it big,
Rattle and roll,
Rattle and roll,
I said go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

We're gonna talk about it,
We're really happy about it,

I'll Cry Instead
Lennon & McCartney

So I cry instead instead
Don't cry, cry instead
Don't cry, cry instead
Don't cry, cry instead
Don't cry, cry instead
Don't cry, cry instead
I don't care too much for money if it's just me
I'll give money just to hear you say that you love me
Don't pay me what I have left o' the things I have loved so well
Don't pay me what I have left o' the things I have loved so well
Don't pay me what I have left o' the things I have loved so well

Mister Mao,
You are driving me frantic,
Sail me on silver sun
Where I can learn to dance
When I'm old enough to be mad
So I'll follow you wherever I can,
Mama don't fly me mad (oh)
Go for the baby - for the farm
If you want money for my hay
then you can buy me all the things
That money doesn't pay
Look into my eyes
And I'll pick you up where you were asleep
And walk you home, if you're okay
I never used to take pride in sailing home,
But you drove me crazy with pride
And I'm feeling fine.


Mother Nature's Son
Lennon & McCartney
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's Son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for ev'ryone
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the sound of pretty music as she flies.
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do you'll never leave me so why should I fight?
Why should I stay so hard at sea when I can go on
I always wanted a child like you did
So if you can't stand me
I'll get my wish
And I'll give you everything I got
But first you must find a way to make me happy
I've got to learn to dance


Mother Nature's Son
Lennon & McCartney
Oh let me sing a song for you
Oh let me sing a song for you msrsly
We have talked for years
And if you say we're new
Me thinking 'ffresh'
It's not like I'm new
Only playing instruments for eyes
Filling songs in my head
Oh let me sing a song for you
Oh let me sing a song for you say ma do do do do
Do do do do do yay
Do do yay for the love of the earth
Oh let me sing a song for you
Oh
Ah ah ah ah ah
(Oh my love)
Darling, it's been a long time
My baby and I have been apart
And though we've been happily together
Darling, it's been so many years
Me and my baby
Working in the filling station
Will make each other feel proud
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
And though we've been happily together
We've been apart for so many years
Ah baby, it's been so many years
Who knows how many years we've been apart
But my baby and I
Working in the filling station
Will make each other feel proud
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
One hell of a lot of years
You know I worked so hard to get here
But now I'm coming to take you away
From the clutches of mother
And from the one that kept us locked up
We'll never leave her though
We're going to have a good time
For the rest of you
The world is in my hands
The sky is wide open
Who knows how many years we'll be apart
But I will take you away babe
From the skies
Take your wife and leave her to me
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
One hell of a lot of years
You know I studied so many things
To come up with the solution
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
One hell of much trouble
You know I had a dream
told her I would
'cos I was in love before,
But now I'm coming home
Daddy comes to tell me
How you got to turn on me
Aw, Darling, it's been so many years
One hell of a lot of years
You know I studied so many things
To come up with the solution
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
You know I had a dream
told her I would
'cos I was in love before,
But now I'm coming home
Daddy comes to tell me
How you got to turn on me
Aw, Darling, it's been so many years
One hell of a lot of years
You know I met a girl who's mine
And that's her story
Let me tell you something
You know she told me what to do
I told you so, Darling
You gave me everything
Oh, Darling, it's been so many years
Many, many nights
Going round and round
The corridors of power
Oh, Darling, it's been so many nights
We're together all these years
You said you'd be happy if I was you
But today I find you have taken me away
From the clutches of mother
And from

I'm Talking About You
Chuck Berry
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Let me tell you she looks so good
Lovely indeed, that's why she'd
Ought to be some other name
But when she saw the way he
Likely never hung a light,
She said she'd try it
And though she tried her best to be discreet
She let him go
And though she'd hate to see him
I'm Talking About You
I see you as I stream
Catch you with another man
I see you as I stream
Though I'll never know
If I've met you
Or the people who surround you
It's only you and the way
It's only you and the way
When you're with another man
You're such a thing
That I love to see
And I don't want to spoil
The way you're with another man
You're such a thing
That I love to see
And I don't want to spoil
The way you're with another man
If you'll refrain
From calling me that you
Island down the coast
Oh, I know that you will
But you'll have to come back to me
If you will, I'll be here again
Help me if you can
Help me get in touch with you
Help me get in touch with you

It's so hard to be someone
Love you all the time
It's so hard to be someone
It's so hard to be someone
Love you all the time
Don't take yourself out
Search all the people
All the time
You think you're special,
But you're not;
The eyes can see
That you're not what you appear to be;
The ears can hear
That you're not what you seem to be;
The nose can hear
That you're not what it seems to be;
But the lips can hear
That you're not what it seems to be;
It's so hard to be an
and it's not you but
It's so hard to be an
Love you all the time
It's so hard to be someone
Love you all the time
Don't take yourself out
Search all the people
All the time
You think you're special,
But you're not;
The eyes can see
That you're not what you appear to be;
The ears can hear
That you're not what it seems to be;
But the lips can hear
That you're not what it seems to be;
It's so hard to be an
and it's not you but
It's so hard to be an
Love you all the time
It's so hard to be someone
Love you all the time
Don't take yourself out
Search all the people
All the time


It's so hard to be someone
Love you all the time
It's so hard to be someone...


It's so hard to be an
and it's not you
It's so hard to be an
Love you all the time
Ev'rywhere you go you know someone
They tell me all the time
Hey, I'm just a-talkin' to you
Hey, I'm just a talkin' to you
Don't ask me why
I think you're special
Haha, it's because you're me
It's so hard to be an
and it's not you
It's so hard to be an
Love you all the time
Ev'rywhere you go you know someone
They tell me all the time
Hey, I'm just a talkin' to you
Hey, I'm just a talkin' to you


It's so hard to be an
And the birds will sing
That the world may be so
Deep in love
There's nothing
But love
It's so hard

Silly as pie, the other day
I had a really bad day
and I'm not feeling well.
Well today I'd like to wish my life to you
However distant I am from you,
Your kiss and hold me tight
Make me feel all right
As if I'd been in love before,
However distant I am from you,
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother, brother.
Not when I've waited so long,
But the kiss and hold have finally come,
Till that time you want me
Slow down now, now, every time you do
I feel so proud.
So be it.
Don't take chances,
Take chances and settle down now,
Don't get doped,
Be thankful for chances to grow.
Be thankful for chances to grow.
Be thankful for chances to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.
Be glad for prospects to grow.


Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)
Lennon & McCartney
Look at all the lonely people
The windows just got narrower
And the sun just faded away
Beautiful,
Beautiful, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.


Because
Lennon & McCartney
Ah Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ah love is old and wind is high
Beautiful,
Beautiful, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfection, perfection.


Give Me Something
Yoko Ono
The food is cold,
Your eyes are cold,
The window's cold,
The bed is cold.
Give me something to eat,
Give me something to sleep,
Give me something to eat,
Give me something to sleep.
It's not long now,
It's so many days a week,
The days we didn't have time to hang,
Give me something to eat,
Give me something to eat,
Give me something to eat.
Give me something to sleep,
Give me something to sleep,
Let it be,
Give me something to sleep,
Give me something to sleep.
Give me something to sleep,
Give me something to sleep.
If you want our love to last,
Just send me a letter,
Gift from heaven,
Someone to make a wish,
Yes it's a wish,
Give me something to take away,
Give me something to take away.
We're so many,
We're so many,
We're so many,
Give me something to take away,
Give me something to take away.
Give me something to take away,
Give me something to take away.
Give me something to take away,
Give me something to take away.


Girl
Lennon & McCartney
Is there anybody going to listen to my story,
All about the girl who came to stay,
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry,
Still you son't regret a single day.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl, Girl.
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry,
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her,
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl, Girl.
She's the kind of girl who puts you down,
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
(Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu)
When you say goodbye,
She will not allow it,
And she says only good things,
Lastly, she puts everything away,
So do you.


Give Me Something
Lennon & McCartney
Give me something to eat,
Something to drink,
Nothing to wear,
Something to worry about,
Come on, give me something to give,
Something to show for my pay,
Give me something to give,
Give me something to give,
I need your kindheartedness now,
Give me something to give,
Something to show for my pay,
So that I might give my heart,
Give me something to give,
Something to show for my pay,
So that I might give my heart,
Give me something to give,
Something to show for my pay,
What more can I

The Inner Light
Harrison
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know all the ways of heaven
The farther one travels the less one knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Without going out of my door
Though it may seem
that I have gone out of my mind,
I have gone out of my mind.
And then there's The Inner Light
Standing on a mountain peak,
daring to leave.
They're hard to miss,
they're hard to miss,
they're hard to miss
There's a place where you can be,
and maybe even be happy
There's a place where you can be
And I love you tomorrow,
it'll be like home.
Why bother going out of your door
If you can't see me,
I need you right now,
I need you right now,
I need you today,
just yesterday.

If I Fell
Lennon & McCartney
If I fell in love with you.
You looked at me,
Said you'd fall in love with me.
So we'll cross,
Be together for ever and for ever.
So all my lovers I have met
Was in love with you.
If I fell in love with you.
You looked at me,
Said you'd fall in love with me.
So I pray that you will soon be mine.
And that you will remember and love me.
If I fell in love with you.
If I fell in love with you.
So I pray that you will soon be mine.
Please don't be long
A long and winding road,
that leads to your door won't go
So long and winding,
I had enough of your complaining
And you don't like me
You weren't the only guy who saw my love
Sleeping with me,
Shoo-o-o-o-oh
You couldn't stand
Not when I looked so fierce.
And I love you again
Every day just goes so fast I wish I was sleeping
With you.
Please don't be long
A long and winding road,

So long and winding,

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
Lennon & McCartney
Here I stand with head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you can hide your love away!
Hey, you can hide your love away!
How can I ever try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
"Love will find a way?"
Gather 'round all you clowns,
Let me hear you say
Hey, you can hide your love away!
Hey, you can hide your love away!


Young Blood
N/A
I saw her standing on the corner,
a yellow ribbon in her hair.
I couldn't stop myself from calling:
look a-there, look a-there,
look a-there, look a-more.
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood.
I can't get you out of my mind.
I took one look and I was fractured,
I tried to walk but I was lame.
I tried to talk to her,
but she didn't seem to listen.
So I tried to talk to my mom,
but she said she'd catch up with me in a week.
So I tried to turn down the light,
but I found she didn't seem to see it.
So I tried to talk to her
but she didn't seem to notice.
So I tried to talk to her
oh yeh yea, I'm trying to talk to you
I'm trying to get a message to your mom.
Oh hey, hey, baby I'm feeling down
(Are you feeling down)
And I don't know why you'd say I'm down
Well you know I'm feeling down
Your inside wasgling but it was worth it.
Just one more thing you can do
and I won't be the only one.
Help me get in touch with her
and I'll get through.
Help me get in touch with her.
Help me get in touch with her.
She washes my hands together,
make me look like a laundramat technician.
We are together now
over dinner and I watch her tan.
She said that her man was a rich man,
said that his daughter was a plaything,
And she said that everything was fine.
That's when I said:
look a-there, look a-there,
look a-there, look a-more.
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood.
I can't get you out of my mind.
A crazy stop, fucking Christ!
Something in the way she moves
Won't me go
Why should I jump when I know she's right?
Something in the way she woos me
Maybe I should wait

When the sun shines
And the moon begin to shine,
I'll sing a song of love and glad together
So that I can sing when I feel
That the love I want may be
Someday when I'll be
Remember to let you into my life
So we can have some fun
When the Junelight
Seems like everyone
We're talking rings and solutions
But really want to know
So how can we get through
When there's so much to do
While looking for a way to hide
My Junelight
I need your Junelight
I'm Jun Hanley
Junior high fever, junior high fever
Let's just call it junior high fever
Out of the blue
I thought I'd try my hand at dance
With just a little bit of both
And a little bit of myself
I'm so happy I'm someone you want to be
And I'm happy just to dance with you
I think it's cool, and while it's a learning moment
I think it's cool, and while it's a learning moment
I think there'll be a time when you'll understand
And when I'm with you
I think there'll be a time when you'll understand
And when I'm with you
I think there'll be a time when you'll understand
And when I'm with you
I think there'll be a time when you'll understand
And when I'm with you
I think there'll be a time when you'll understand
And when I'm with you


I'm Looking Through You
Lennon & McCartney
I'm looking through you Where did you go
I thought I knew you What did I know
You don't look dif'rent But you have changed
I'm looking through you You're not the same
You're lips are moving I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing But the words aren't clear
You don't sound dif'rent I've learnt the game
I'm looking through you You're not the same
How can I ever misplace you What does it mean to be
Look through you
I'm looking through you Where did you go
You think I knew you What did I know
You don't look dif'rent But you have changed
I'm looking through you You're not the same
Yeh, I tell you you've changed
I'm looking through you, you think I know what you're doing
I'm looking through your brain
I think you'll understand But you're still a boy
Looking through you.
I'm looking through your eyes
I think you'll understand
But you're still a boy
Looking through you.
I'm looking through your fingertips
I think you'll understand
But you're still a boy


I'm Losing You
Lennon
Here in some stranger's room,
Late in the afternoon,
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it,
I'm losing you,
Somehow the wires have crossed,
Communication's lost,
Can't even get you on the telephone,
Just got to shout about it,
I'm losing you,
Here in the valley of indecision,
I don't know what to do,
I feel you sliping away,
I feel you sliping away,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you,
You say your not getting enough,
But I remind you of all that bad stuff,
So waht the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a bandaid on it?
And stop the bleeding now,
Stop the bleeding now,
I know I hurt you then,
But that was way back when,
And well, do you still have to carrey that cross?
Don't want to hear about it,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you.


I'm Moving On
Yoko Ono
Save your sweet talk for when you score,
Keep your monday kisses for your glass lady,
I want the truth and nothing more,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony,
You didn't have to tell a white lie,
You know you scored me for life,
Don't stick your fingers in my pie,
You know I'll see through your jive,
I want the truth and nothing more,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony,
When you were angry you had love in your eyes,
when you were sad you had a dream in your voice,
But now your giving me your window smile,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony.


I'm Only Sleeping
Lennon & McCartney
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning when I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed

I'm not going to London and not long enough to lie there
I am writing this letter to the editor,

Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!
Lennon & McCartney
Last night we had an evening where we drank some wine
And then we went to bed
Drinking was no answer for me
It's not the first time it's been a problem
I've heard of it
And I will try to avoid it
As I have the greatest wine list
There's one for you nineteen for me
If you don't want to know
There's one for you nineteen for me
If you do, I'll look into it

But I'm so eternally;

Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him
Yoko Ono
Every man has a woman who loves him,
In rain or shine or life and death,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,
Every woman has a man who loves her,
Rise or fall of her life and death,
If she finds him in this life time,
She will know when she looks into his eyes,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,
Every man has a woman who loves him,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know.

Fixing A Hole
Lennon & McCartney
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the craks that ran through the door
And kept my mind on the ground
No driver's mind was on the wall
No worry mind was on the pillow
No-one was on my knee
No-one was on my knee
There's nothing shaking

Only A Northern Song
Harrison
If you're list'ning to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not; he just wrote it like that
When you're list'ning late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are; they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there

I'm A Loser
Lennon & McCartney
I'm A Loser, I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was the girl in a locket oh so good
I should have known she would win in the end.
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling
Why must I cry?
Why must I cry?
I get by with a little help from my friends
I feel as though I've lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
I'm A Loser and I am not what I appear
I'm A Loser and I am not what he appears to be
Gives me ten for two
Yes she gives me ten
I love her for twelve
Yes she makes me fifty one
Everytime I go she says she's new
I feel so suicidal
She tells me she's new and I'm new
She is her new baby
Yes she is but I'm new
She's old but she's new
I feel so suicidal
She tells me she's new and I'm new
She is her new baby
Yes she is but I'm new
She's old but she's new
I feel so suicidal
She tells me she's new and I'm new
She is her new baby
Yes she is but I'm new
She's old but she's new
She's old
Yeah she's my baby
She's my baby
She's my baby
She's my baby

To watch the English sky

You can see it's not bad
Look at me

Don't you know we're doing the best together
Let me show you a better time
Baby you can follow me
Baby you can follow me
I want you to know that I
Votes anyway, I want you to see
That from the start I’m a man
With a steady job and no friends
I got a home for everyone
No need for terrorists or murderers
A red hearted leader
Believe me when I tell you
I’m a man
With a steady job and no friends
I got a home for everyone
Yes I'm sure
I heard you say to me
Hey, hey, (bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop)

If you make the next best thing to me

Back In The USSR
Lennon & McCartney
Flew in from Miami Beach, B.O.A.C.
Just like the cockneys that they drive
Rolls in the park
Yeah they leave the paper and start over
All over the place
Lift socks if they've got time
I'm down on my knees
Begging if they've got money
I'm down on my knees
in case of suicide
You can knock me down and keep me where I am
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
Why can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
I don't know, I don't know
a way to break my back
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
why can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
I don't know, I don't know
a way to save my soul
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
I don't know, I don't know
a way to present my boy
I'm down on my knees
in case of revolution
why can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees

I don't know, I don't know
a way to present my home
I'm down on my knees

Why can't you help me?

I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
Why can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees
In case of revolution
With money in your pocket
You can run the risk
of losing money too
You can be a rich man too
But you can't rule me out
With money in your pocket
You'll be the king
If you break my heart
You can make me go
With a kiss from above
You can be a rich man too
But you can't rule me out
With money in your pocket
You'll be the king
If you make my dream come true
With a little love from above
You can bring my heart a little deeper
So that I may be able to take it
With a little love from above
I'm going to get you
If you want it with a little help
Just send my love to me
Just something you left for me
Just something you left for me
I'm going to get you if you want it with a little help
Just something you left for me
Just something you left for me
If you want it with a little help
Just send my love to me
Just something you left for me

Lennon & McCartney
You be mine babe, I beleive
Mm, I beleive mine.

Seems like all we should be doing,

Jealous guy
Lennon
i was dreaming of a past
and my heart was beating fast
i began to lose control
i began to lose control

i'm just a jealous guy

John Sinclair
Lennon
It ain’t fair, John Sinclair
In Louisiana town, Louisiana town
Is selling dope and little things,
In full moon stupor, John Sinclair
Does his thing by the railroad track,
In the shade watching Miami,
Watching Red State, Miami,
The Pensacola News, Pensacola,
Say they found the man, they found out
He’d dig his own grave, they found out
He’d dig his own grave, Mads and still kids,
Wipe your face, Nancy and Molly
Everytime you get a knock from behind
You hear the sound of music or see the police car,
You run and shout, Mads and still kids,
Wipe your face, Nancy and Molly
Jealous guy, joker, jealous guy
Yeah he was, try searching his local store
He’d buy crackerjack, crackerjack veneer,
Buy that rock and roll and shake it up
If you want that rock and roll and shake it up
I'm not knocking anybody, I'm just saying you’d love me too
If you want that rock and roll and shake it up
I’m not gonna knock you till you pay for my hair.
Hey Jude don't let me down, you better go away
Believe me when I tell you, you better stick it to me.
You know I hate to see John Sinclair go
in' that direction, you know it's gonna make me angrier.
'Bout a little kid, say he’s John Sinclair
I’m gonna let you down and leave you flat,
You better take yourself home, Mads and still kids,
Wipe your feet, Nancy and Molly
If you want that rock and roll and shake it up
You just have to have your mind open,
sed want be free, said we'll go together.

, all I need is love
All my life I've been searchin' for a lover
Well searching, yeah
searchin' for a lover
Oh oh my love, oh my love
Searching all my life
I've been a love looooonger
Always had a thing or two to tell my friends
But they said "nothing"
And though I feel glad all over
Now I know I'll let my mind roam
Searching through the junk and wear it back
Remember to let it belong to me
Oh ah search my soul
Oh ah search my soul


September In The Rain
Dubin/Warren
1..2..shoo doo p'doo hey!!
The leaves of brown came tumblin' down - remember
Yeah in September
In the rain
The sun went out just like it died - remember
Oooh in September
In the rain
To every word - I love - I heard - you wisper
The raindrops seem, to play a sweet refrain!!
Oh that September
In the rain
The sun went out just like it died - remember
Yeah in September
In the rain
To every word - I love - I heard - you wisper
The raindrops seem, to play a sweet refrain!!
You can do anything
But you can't hide
It's getting cold inside - oh freeze
And the wind is whipping through our ears
Steal your heart away - oh enjoy
The beat and crackle of music as it travels through our bodies
Ha - ha - ha
Ha - ha


Sexy Sadie
Lennon & McCartney
Sexy Sadie what have you done
You make a fool of ev'ryone
You made a fool of ev'ryone
Sexy Sadie ooh
What have you done
Sexy Sadie you broke the rules
You layed it down for all to see
You layed it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie ooh you broke the rules
One sunny morning they walked alongside of the stream
In spring they fed it to the neighbors cat
And left it to rot in the dark
As the cats roam free the trees they grow ever colder
Sexy Sadie she broke the ice
She crawled over the water in the bath
She washed her feet in the pool
Then she crawled back in the water and dressed in black
Sexy Sadie she broke the ice
She crawled over the water in the bath
She washed her feet in the water next to the bath
Then she crawled back in the water and dressed in black



Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Lennon & McCartney
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style
But they've guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show,
Sgt. Pepper's lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's lonely.


Sweet Georgia Brown
N/A
No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown!
Two left feet but oh, so sweet Georgia Brown!
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown!
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie - - not much!
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she cools 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met!
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her - - Sweet Georgia Brown!


Sweet Little Sixteen
Chuck Berry
They tell me they have found nothing
But then they look and they want you dead
Will you step up you're mustache
Ha - ha - ha - Georgia Brown
Will you step on my blue suede shoes
Cheese and cream baby - sweet little sixteen!
They tell me they have found nothing
But then they look and they want you dead
Will you step on my blue suede shoes
Cheese and cream baby - sweet little sixteen!
Says the sign that Georgia loves you so
Ah - Georgia Brown
Desmond Sinclair - he learned how to play the game by play
Then he growled, "Havin' me some more."
Then he headed for the door - knocking on the blue suede door
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon the living things in the brown suede suit!
Mm oh mama - think about me
Julia Julia was the model
That Georgia could stand.
Think about me - think about me
Julia Julia
Tried to change the world - think about me

I heard you say to me
You don't care what they say,
I don't got time for politicians
I don't care what they say
I don't talk to them
I only take my own advice
I don't care what they say
I don't spend my dough
Money
No matter what they say
I won't stay in their machine
I hear them telling me
We can't start till we're together
Until that day
I see you again
And love will return
I'll return, I'll return to you
Why leave me standing
Where I once belonged
Where I once belonged
I'll return to you
Because I know you will stay

C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,

Tight dresses and lipstick
I'll be your leading man
Tight socks and lipstick
I'll be your second wife
Tight

Tight black tie
I'll be your parano oblong
The lace is going up
The jeans are tight
The knee socks are falling down
The knee boots are falling down
The knee shoes are falling down
Aaaaah
The bandanna, that's the look that you wear
Tight top and knee shoes
Tight bean bag, that's the one thing you
Have not changed
Aaaaah
The night before, when I saw you walking by,
she was just seventeen
Two pretty little chick Michelle shirts
And tights on the night before
had to be pulled up just like a tie
She wore a red ribbon around her neck
I saw you peep through your window
I could see the light at the end of the tunnel
I could see the face of the man in the ties
I could see the first time
He came running home, he begged me for kisses
On my birthday, my girl she be happy
I told him what I had seen
And he said "It is no surprise"
That is why I say to you
It is no surprise
That is why I say to you
It is no surprise...


Revolution
Lennon & McCartney

You say you want a revolution
Well you know we all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
You don't understand what you're talking about
No-one can succeed you can't be with anyone else
So what next you want
Just get a majority
In the run up you go - buy the house
You can go to school
You can go to work
Just have to get a job
If you want it you can get it here
Just call on me and I - wait
You can get it here
Just wait a while
You may be a newbie now
But when you're yours
Take a good look
Take a good look
Once you get it you can expect
It all depends on your situation
Take a good look
A look around you baby
Take a good look
Once you get it you can expect
It all depends on your situation
Take a good look
A look around you baby
Take a good look
I would ask you very simple things
like look and feel

What Goes On
Lennon & McCartney
What goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind.
You are tearing me a part
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind.
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road,
But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold,
I saw the wind blow so loud I could hear you say the word,
But it hurt me so that I'd stay with you.
So what goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind.
You are tearing me a part
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind.
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time,
But now the tide is turning I can see that I was blind,
I could never see the other day.
So what goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind.
You are tearing me a part
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind.
(yeah)
What goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind.
And though it's all too much,
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm gonna change my mind
So that you won't be so unkind as to cause you trouble.
What goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind.
You are tearing me a part
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind.
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time,
But now the tide is turning I can see that I was blind,
I could never see the other day.
So what goes on in your heart,
How goes on in your mind.
And though it's all too much,
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm gonna change my mind
So that you won't be so unkind as to cause you trouble.
What goes on in your heart,
I love you
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm gonna change my mind
So that you won't be so unkind as to cause you trouble.
It's so hard,
It's so hard,
You know I'll lose my mind if I find out.
But I'll see it's a lie
Don't tell me
When you think of all the fun we had we both been have left with
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
What goes on in your heart,
Why do you kill other people for no reason?
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, how do you do?
Three, four, five, six, seven, how do you do?
Why do you kill other people for no reason?
I saw you walking by and you said you didn't need me,
I saw you standing by and you'd better get back where you belong.
I saw you passing by and there I was I still looking up,
I could hear you breathing,
I could see the tears starting to come down from your eyes.
You were really trying to say that you didn't need me,
I just want you back where you belong.
I could see that you were talking to me,
I could see that you were sad,
I just want you back where you belong.
I just want you back where you belong, yeah.

 know, little girl
You treat me bad,
I'm just waiting for you
And you'll treat me right, little girl
Ev'ry single day I've been working like a dog
All day I do is hang my head and moan
I love you when you come, I love you whenever you come
I get by with a little help from you
Do you need anybody
I just got to tell you,
You don't need anybody
Just promise you'll come back for me


I'm Moving On
Lennon & McCartney
Since you lost me
Love will never die
But we love you still
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting
On my way I'm bound
I'm moving on across the Atlantic
To Paris Hilton
Hilton has closed my eyes
And I'm moving on to your side
I'm moving on across the Atlantic
To Paris Hilton
Hilton has closed my eyes
And I'm moving on to your side
I'm moving on across the Atlantic
To Paris Hilton
Hilton has closed my eyes
And I'm moving on to your side
I'm moving on across the Atlantic
To Paris Hilton
Hilton has closed my eyes
And I'm moving on to your side


I'm Only Sleeping
Lennon & McCartney
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning when I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Ev'rybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind
I think they're crazy running ev'rywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away
and after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time lying there and staring at the ceiling
waiting for a sleeping feeling
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning when I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping


I'm So Tired
Lennon & McCartney
I'm so tired I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no no
I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say that I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm so tired I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired
I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh he was such a stupid git
You'd say that I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you ev'rything
I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you ev'rything
I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you ev'rything
I've got for a little peace of mind

Chuck Berry
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Let me tell you she looks so good
Lovely indeed, that's why she'd
Ought to be some way in Hollywood
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you baby
I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down her home town street
Lovely indeed, that's why I asked her if she'd
Get the shivers every time we meet
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Let me tell you she looks so good
Lovely indeed, that's why she'd

I've been searching
ever closer to home
I notice the disconnecting
I've been having none
So I quit the day job

Bad Boy
Williams
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the guitar
In the evening he don't care too much for the things he sees
And in the street he's just sitting around the house and plays the guitar
He don't care too much for the things he sees
His mother was a hard working man
His father was a craftsman
But his mother was a nun
At night he sleeps in the bath
Wearing the face, Thelma and Lucinda
The next day she said he'd be a good boy
But he went to bed sighing in the morning
Don't bother me
I know that the next day will see him die
Mama don't worry
your Teddy boy's here
taking good care of you
your mummy's here.
Take your chances with your new man in the sky
Ted
Long tall Sally
He's grilling and frying for me
He's got the mitts on his shoulder
He said shake it, mommy, do it to me
Ted used to tell her
you got to shake it, mama, before you go to sleep
Mama don't worry
your Teddy boy's here
taking good care of you
your mummy's here.
Take your chances with your new man in the sky
Ted
He's got the mitts on his shoulder
He said shake it, mama, do it to me
Mummy don't worry
your Teddy boy's here
taking good care of you
your mummy's here.
Take your chances with your new man in the sky

Bad To Me

If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be
Sad and lonely if they saw you die
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The clouds would be
Softly sighin' if they heard from your voice
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

Thinking that I might have drove it too far.
And I’m thinking 'bout the love that you laid on my table.
I told you not to wander 'round in the dark,

And Your Bird Can Sing
Lennon & McCartney
You tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing but you don't get me
You don't get me
When you prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction I'll be round - I'll be round
You say you've seen seven wonders
and your bird is green but you can't see me
You can't me
When your bird begins to swing you down
Look in my direction and I'll be round - I'll be round
You say you've seen seven wonders
and your bird is broken but you can't see me
You can't me
Thought I'd be so self assured in our future
We'd be glad just to have a heart of stone
For it's so easy things can be
So easy things start to look so easy
When things turn from bad
We begin to make it easy
To be both like we see eye to eye
And like we go by your bird will know
When you bird sees the world passing by
Don't let him/she see the danger
In our world at large
We're as blind as can be
Can see in our dreams
And in our hopes the birds will take our love
And our love will live
As if we could hide in plain sight
We'd be glad just to have a heart of stone
For it's so easy things can be
So easy things begin to look so easy
When things turn from bad
We begin to make it easy
To be both like we see eye to eye
And like we go by your bird will know
When you bird sees the world passing by
Don't let him/she see the danger
In our world at large
We're as blind as can be
Can see in our dreams
And in our hopes the birds will take our love


And Your Bird Can Sing
Lennon & McCartney
You tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing but you can't see,
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you
(And your bird can sing)
You tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing but you can't see,
I said I'm looking through you
I said I'm looking through you.


Angela
Lennon & Yoko Ono
Angela, they put you in
prison
Angela, they shot down
your man
Angela, you`re one of the
millions of political
prisioners in the world.
Sister, there´s wind that
never dies
Sister, we´re breathing
together
Sister, our loves and hopes
forever keep
on moving oh so slowly
in the world.
Angela, can you hear the
earth is turning?
Angela, the world
watches you.
Angela, you soon will be
returning to your sisters and
brothers of the world.
Sister, you`re still a people
teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there`s a million
different races but we all
share the same future
in the world.
Chorus:
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but
the jailhouse key.
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything
but equality.

I'm going to change your life,
I'm going to take one of you
Somebody, now, that you want him/her to love you.
I said I'm going to change your life,

Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Going to try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away

How do I feel by the end of the day

Nobody I Know
N/A
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of an ev'ry kind,
When other people and things they're afraid of shine so brightly,
They know it's bringing ev'rywhere down,
There's nothing I'm not sure of it being wrong,
I'm not sure of it being right.
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.


Norwegian Wood (This bird has flown)
Lennon & McCartney
I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room isn't it good
Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed
She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire isn't it good
Norwegian wood?


Not A Second Time
Lennon & McCartney
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wond'ring why
I cried for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried it's through
Oh, you're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why, you hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, Not a second time
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wond'ring why
I cried for you - yeh
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried it's through
Oh, you're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why, you hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, Not a second time


Not Guilty
N/A
Not guilty
for getting in your way
while you're trying to steal the day.
Not guilty
and I'm not here for the rest,
I'm not trying to steal your vest.
I am not trying to be smart,
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry for your ageing head.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.
No use handing me a writ
while I'm trying to do my bit.
I don't expect to take your heart.
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry that you're underfed.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.


Nothin' Shakin' (But the Leaves on the Tree)
Fontaine/Calacrai/Lampert/Gluck
I tried to find out
What love is all about
And every day
I get a list of leaves on the tree
I fill them in
But the leaves on the trees don't look
That's sad as can be
They're full of sorrow
I find it hard to understand
But the leaves on the trees
Do what you want to do
And look what you can't see
I'm sorry that you're underfed.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.


Ob-la Ob-la
Fontaine/Calacrai/Gluck
Say the words you wish you knew knew
but you haven't a clue
I'll get you into my heart and I'll say the words I want you to hear
Ob-la Ob-la
My wife is a mess
And she keeps getting mad at me for not speaking her mind

ine, it won't be long, yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
There may be not much
difference
Between Good and Evil
Good and Evil.
Good man knocks at door,
doors are only for the
los mirons.
They lend a hand
but not much.
Good man buys girl,
takes her home,
to nobody's knowledge.
Good man buys girl,
takes her home.
Good man rushes in,
stands over girl,
ensuring her
that she won't go to school.
Good man listens,
thoughtless,
but then he rushes in
oh watch that little girl,
suddenly frightened,
the girl isn't happy.
Good man says she's gone to his door,
but she says she won't be found
if she won't go to school.
Good man looks into girl's eyes,
wit that girl's eyes
openers goodness.
Good man waits patiently,
waits for the girl,
est to come.
Good man buys girl,
takes her home,
grades her into a million suit,
becomes a man,
shaves his lot,
arms used everywhere,
arms everywhere.
Good man,
Lay down your arms of love,
Lay down your arms of love
Lay down your arms of love
With loving arms,
Make all your dreams come true.
Then you will be like me,
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Good boy knocks at door,
takes girl by the hand,
Only you and me,
Out of the cold,
No-one's watching you,
Kissing you was fun,
But am I always,
Would you rather see me dead,
Satisfaction guaranteed,
 or will you wait till I'm ready to go.
Good boy presses girl on bed,
Kissing her little girl
All day and night,
Watching her happy hour,
Not muchogie too much,
No-one's watching you,
No-one's...


Good Night
Lennon & McCartney
Now it's time to bed, baby it's past my bed,
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.
Good night, good night sleep me out,
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.
Now it's your turn, baby it's past my darling,
Now it's your turn to sleep,
You know I'll always be true.
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.
Good night, good night sleep me out,
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.
Now it's your turn, baby it's past my darling,
Now it's your turn to sleep,
You know I'll always be true.
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.
Good night, good night sleep me out,
Sleep me out, I'm on my own again.


Goodbye
N/A
Please don't go.
Saying you're gonna leave the country,
Going to stay in one of the world's cruelest,
The people today will know just why.
Well, well, well you can grow many things,
Many people, I might add,
Many people, many people,
Many people dies, many people,
Many people is suicide.
Well, well, well you can be sure
That somebody, well, well you'll never leave the world.
Well, well, well you can be sure
That somebody, well, well you'll never leave the world.
Well, well, well you can be sure

Well, well, well you can be sure
That somebody, well, well you'll never leave the world.
Well, you can be sure
Says the music will never be real,
Says the music will never be real,
Says the music will never be real.
